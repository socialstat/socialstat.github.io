"Large health disparities across Socio Economic Status (SES) groups in Italy have received little attention in recent years from researchers, from the health policy community and from public. For these considerations, health equity must be a guide principle for public health options. This is reflected in the global commitments to ???live no one behind??? expressed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of United Nations. 
It is important to recognise the urgency to go beyond words and move toward decidedly in the design and the implementation of pro-equity and social health policies at both the global and local levels.
Therefore, our work reviews the conceptual and methodological framework for tackling health equity and identifies a social gradient in health, that is: the lower individual social position, the worse their health outcomes and, at conversely the higher social position, the better they health.
In order to conceptualise the measurement of health inequalities, a methodological approach encompasses two simple steps:
1.	Comparing the state of health of two or more socially defined groups;
2.	Expressing those comparisons in summary metric of health inequalities, using Kuznets index (KI), Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Concentration Index (CI).
In conclusion, the measurement of health inequalities has its axiological basis in the social determinants of health multilevel model and in the eco-epidemiological paradigm.
Therefore, these three essential instruments are necessary and sufficient to inform the generation of evidence-based policies to advance equity in health and to monitoring the impact that ongoing population health interventions can have or not have."
