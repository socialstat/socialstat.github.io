Educational achievement can be considered a multifaceted issue, which comprises different domains of learning. In Italy, on one hand the INVALSI tests administered to students through the schooling years aim to measure the ability of students in numeracy, literacy and English reading and listening competencies, separately.  On the other hand, the high school final mark may be considered an overall performance outcome, formed by the combination of several marks in different subjects. Finally, at university academic achievement may be represented by the number of credits earned during the first year of enrollment, usually considered a good predictor of successful academic performances. The aim of the present work is to understand if the INVALSI scores, the high school final mark and the number of credits earned in the first academic year are associated. More specifically, our objective is twofold: first, we intend to verify if and how the INVALSI scores are associated with students.
