Statistical and taste-based discrimination: an application of Discrimination Decomposition Index (DDI) using first- and second-generation immigrants 

Introduction

Economic theory splits discrimination into statistical and and taste-based one. While the first one holds when the judgement of an individual is determined by group characteristics rather than individual ones, the second occurs when the preference for a certain group is based on tastes, rather than any economic rationale (see Lahey, 2008 for a review). Indeed, we constructed a specific index able to separate the two kinds of discrimination using the difference in treatment devoted to native, first- and second- generation immigrants (Busetta et al., 2018; Busetta et al., 2020).

Objective

The aim of this paper is to apply our Discrimination Decomposition Index (DDI), using a sample drawn from the dataset ""Condition and Social Integration of Foreign Citizens, SCIF 2011-2012"", provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). It consists of 25,326 individuals: 20,379 are foreign citizens, 4,251 are native born and 696 Italian citizens for acquisition.

Methods

We used the proportion of individuals in the state of workers belonging to the different categories (native, first- and second-generation immigrants) as proxy of the amount of discrimination devoted to that category, and we applied DDI to evaluate the relevance of statistical and taste-based discrimination to immigrants in Italy.

Results

It emerges the presence of a relevant amount of taste-based discrimination in Italy, other than statistical one. This result appears to be particularly relevant because, following economic theory, while statistical discrimination is considered efficient in the case of imperfect information (Arrow, 1973), taste-based discrimination is always inefficient in terms of overall social welfare (Becker, 1971). 

Conclusion

In light of our results, it would be highly recommendable to provide specific policies to achieve higher level of efficiency to enhance overall social welfare.
